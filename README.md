# Shakespeare Text Generation with TensorFlow Federated

## Overview

This repository contains an example of text generation using TensorFlow Federated (TFF) on the Shakespeare dataset. The goal is to demonstrate how to use federated learning to train a language model on decentralized client data.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.6+
- TensorFlow Federated (TFF)
- TensorFlow
- NumPy

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow-federated tensorflow numpy
```
# Code Overview
## Dependencies
The code starts by importing necessary Python libraries and setting random seeds for reproducibility.

## Model Loading and Text Generation
The load_model function loads a pre-trained text generation model, and the generate_text function generates text using the loaded model.

## Data Loading
The Shakespeare dataset is loaded using TFF's tff.simulation.datasets.shakespeare.load_data() function. The data is preprocessed into suitable input for the model.

## Preprocessing
Functions for data preprocessing and creating a TensorFlow dataset for training are defined. The text is tokenized, split into input and target sequences, and batched.

## Model Evaluation
A custom evaluation metric FlattenedCategoricalAccuracy is defined to evaluate the model's accuracy. The federated model is compiled and evaluated on an example dataset and random data.

## Federated Learning
A federated model is created using TensorFlow Federated. The create_tff_model function defines the model structure for federated training. The federated averaging process is built, and training is performed in multiple rounds.
